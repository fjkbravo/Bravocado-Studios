    <h3>Hello and welcome to my little corner of the internet! Below you will find 3 links that will give you a brief introduction to who I am, some interests and hobbies, and a special feature/game for you to enjoy! Thanks for stopping by!</h3>
        
    <div class="Link1"> <!-- BIO -->
            <a href="#" id="Link1">- About Me </a>
                <p id="Link1content">A little about me - I was born in December, raised in Philadelphia and am 100% ColombianðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´. I love listening to music, indulging in food, and spending time learning about things I find interesting. Quick fun fact about me is I have spotted nosed cat named <a href="#" id="Jobin" data-image="Jobin.jpeg">Jobin</a>, AND a spotted nosed dog named <a href="#" id="Canelo" data-image="Canelo.jpeg">Canelo</a>! Canelo loves Jobin and always wants to play, and Jobin...well, Jobin does not always feel the same way about Canelo.</p>

            <div id="Link2container">
                <p id="Link2content">My dog is a pain in the you know what! But thankfully he keeps me active! Whether it be a walk, run, bike or car ride, trips to the park or a visit to Vida, his dog cousin, hanging out with Canelo is easily one of life's simple pleasures. These activities are likely always done with music playing in my ears too! Music for me is food for the soul and has the power to change your mood - here's a <a href="#" id="playlist">playlist I curated<span class="playlistCaption">Don't worry, it's sfw!</span></a> for you to enjoy some tunes while you're here!</p> <p>I wanted to also mention playing billiards, I absolutely love it as a hobby! It requires skill, a steady hand, a strong mind and a desire to win to see all the possible ways to pocket every ball. It requires strategy that makes you consider playing defense and offense - and while yes, in every game of 15-ball pool the winner eventually cues up the 8ball as their last shot, it is from the very beginning of a game, that there has likely never been that same ball spread after a break before in the history of pool! Every single game of billiards is different in that regard and it is one of the many reasons I enjoy playing so much!</p>

I believe our stories are already written, but we still have the power to shape how they unfold. The Magic 8-Ball is a playful way to let the universe guide your path depending on what you really want. Ask it any yes or no question, and see what direction the universe nudges you toward. Have fun!
